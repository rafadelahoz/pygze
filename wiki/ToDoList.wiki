Things to be done. May be features to implement, tasks to complete, bugs to fix...


= Tasklist =

 * Implement ImageManager: Loads and provides singleton copies of pixel surfaces.(Used by GfxEngine in a transparent to the programmer way) (Beware of surface modifications to the singleton!)

 * Implement SoundEngine: Provides functions to load, play and general control over Sounds *and* Music.

 * Implement Sound[Music?]Manager: Loads and provides singleton copies of sounds and/or musics. (Implement one Manager for sounds and one for music?)

 * Implement TextEngine (name not final), with functions load, manage fonts and render text to screen. (Maybe TextBoxes too?)

 * Implement TileMap (Graphic derivate that represents a tile map)

 * Implement SolidGrid (Mask derivate that implements collisions against a tile map) <= thinking involved.

 * Fully encapsulate pygame (Rects, Input Constants...)
